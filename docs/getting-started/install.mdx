# Installation

:::danger
Creating a hosting company is a serious responsibility, including **legal liability** - it requires solid knowledge of **network infrastructure**, **Linux systems**, and related technologies.
If you don't know what you're doing, **don't do it**. Please, before you install and use this dashboard, for your customers' sake, and for your sake, **gain some Linux knowledge**.

We also reserve the right to deny you support on our Discord server if you lack at least basic technical knowledge or understanding of what you're doing.

Having mentioned this, we can proceed with the installation.

Installing CtrlPanel is fairly straightforward and not much different to setting up Pterodactyl. Our documentation is written for Debian-based systems. Be sure to read the comments for each command carefully, they often contain important information!
